 ## IMPLEMENTING  LINEAR REGRESSION ALGORITHMS IN PYTHON:
 
  Initially  I install  all the  required libraries to perfrom the regression.there are two types of regression
  one is simple linear regression and  the other is multi linear regression . Here i uploaded the linear regression  code 
  
  
  ##  IoT BASED INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION USING RASPBERRY PI 
 The main objective of this project  is to save valuable time and money in largescale industries by using IOT technology including a mini computer called as raspberry pi. We can find the temperature and humidity of an industry by using humidity sensor to monitor air conditioners in industry automatically.
It mainly depends on IOT when we give proper connections. without failure by using cayenne IOT builder. when we give
Proper channel number in that app and icon after that, 
We have to add actuator. when we on the switch led will blink. 
That means that we can run the industry automatically. Wherever we present and similarly we can run the motor. From this we can say that we can find the working times of workers and machine working

### STUDENT MANGAEMENT SYSTEM
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
STUDENT  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (SMS)   is a web-based application that tracks  current student academic information. The proposed system SMS manages the information about  students’ profile, courses, attendance, marks  and Percentage. It  also manages to keep all the records of students  Performance and Progress.
User can access anywhere anytime to view their data . Student Management system is a Software which is helpful for Students as well as the Educational institutes .  Our Student Management  System deals with the various activities related to the students.  
In the Software we can register as a user and user has of two types, student  and administrator.
Administrator has the power to add new user and can edit and delete a user. A student can register as user and view their marks and printout the marks . The administrator can add edit and delete marks for the student as well as subjects and classes . All the users can see the marks and printout them as a PDF format.

There are mainly 2 modules in this software 
•	Admin module
•	Student Module 
### DIABETES  Prediction using ML 
Key Motivation for the Project
I decided to grow my machine learning skills by engaging in diabetes prediction. I did this not only for fun and to learn but also to appreciate the essence of machine learning in solving some of the problems that plague humanity. This is, therefore, an interesting project.
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It is provided courtesy of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database and is available on Kaggle. Here is the link to the dataset. It consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on
