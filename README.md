 IMPLEMENTING  LINEAR REGRESSION ALGORITHMS IN PYTHON:
 
  Initially  I install  all the  required libraries to perfrom the regression.there are two types of regression
  one is simple linear regression and  the other is multi linear regression . Here i uploaded the linear regression  code 
  
  
  ##  IoT BASED INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION USING RASPBERRY PI 
 The main objective of this project  is to save valuable time and money in largescale industries by using IOT technology including a mini computer called as raspberry pi. We can find the temperature and humidity of an industry by using humidity sensor to monitor air conditioners in industry automatically.
It mainly depends on IOT when we give proper connections. without failure by using cayenne IOT builder. when we give
Proper channel number in that app and icon after that, 
We have to add actuator. when we on the switch led will blink. 
That means that we can run the industry automatically. Wherever we present and similarly we can run the motor. From this we can say that we can find the working times of workers and machine working
